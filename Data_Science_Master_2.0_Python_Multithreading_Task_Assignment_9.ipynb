    "### Q1: What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multithreading in Python is a way of achieving multitasking, where multiple parts of a program are executed simultaneously\n",
    "-  It is similar to multiprocessing, but instead of using multiple processes, it uses threads\n",
    "- A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution.\n",
    "- It is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an operating system.\n",
    "- Threads can exist within one process, and each thread contains its own register set and local variables1.\n",
    "- All threads of a process share global variables and the program code\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrency:\n",
    "Multithreading allows multiple operations to run concurrently in the same program. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a program needs to perform multiple tasks at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency: \n",
    "Multithreading can make a program more efficient. It allows a program to continue executing while waiting for I/O operations to complete, such as reading from or writing to a file, or sending or receiving data over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responsiveness:\n",
    "In GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications, multithreading can be used to keep the user interface responsive while performing long-running operations in the background\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resource Sharing:\n",
    "Threads within the same process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called the threading module."

    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: \n",
    "- Multithreading allows multiple operations to run concurrently in the same program, which can improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency:\n",
    "- It allows a program to continue executing while waiting for I/O operations to complete, such as reading from or writing to a file, or sending or receiving data over a network.\n",

    "Responsiveness:\n",
    "- In GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications, multithreading can be used to keep the user interface responsive while performing long-running operations in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing:\n",
    "- Threads within the same process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilization of Multiprocessor Systems:\n",
    "- On systems with multiple CPUs or cores, multithreading can take advantage of the hardware resources by distributing threads across multiple cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Complexity:\n",
    "- Multithreaded programs are more complex and harder to write, understand, debug and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization Issues:\n",
    "- Care must be taken to avoid race conditions where multiple threads access shared data simultaneously. This requires synchronization which can be difficult to implement correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead:\n",
    "- Creating, managing and switching between threads introduces some overhead. If not managed correctly, this could lead to decreased performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpredictable Results:\n",
    "- Due to the nature of thread scheduling and timing, the results of multithreaded programs can be unpredictable and non-deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Deadlocks:\n",
    "- Improper use of synchronization primitives can lead to deadlocks where two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starvation:\n",
    "- This occurs when a thread doesn’t get regular access to shared resources and fails to resume its work\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Q6: Explain deadlocks and race conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "- A deadlock is a situation in a multithreaded environment where two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources. \n",
    "- For example, if Thread A holds Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2 which is held by Thread B, and Thread B is waiting for Resource 1, a deadlock occurs.\n",
    "- Both threads will wait indefinitely because neither will release the resource it holds until it acquires the resource it’s waiting for1. This is often visualized as a circular wait condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "- A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time.\n",
    "- As a result, the values of variables may be unpredictable as they can be dependent on the timings of context switches of the processes.  \n",
    "-For example, if two threads are reading a value from a variable and updating it simultaneously without synchronization, they might both read the same value, perform calculations on it, and write back incrementally updated values.\n",
    "- However, since both read the original value, one of the updates would be lost, leading to incorrect results.\n",
    "- This is why synchronization is crucial in multithreaded environments"
